## Heatmap alignment

As a user, I need the heatmap rows to correspond to the tree nodes, as it will be easier to spot patterns.

## Heatmap inputs

As a user, I need to be able to view copy number (CN), SNV, breakpoints, and other heatmaps that can be expressed as a matrix.

- Create loader
- GraphQL layer
- Render

## Heatmap plot swap

As a user, I want to swap between heatmap plots if there are multiple kinds of plots loaded.

## Additional information

As a user, I want to be able to see additional information (ID, accompanying tree node) about a row when I hover over it.
