## Deployment

As a developer, I want to set up a production-level instance of Lyra in an easy manner.

- Write playbook to create clusters of Elasticsearch nodes (latest version)
- Write playbook to create a webserver with graphQL layer and nginx reverse proxy
- Write documentation on how to run playbooks

As a user, I want to load the output of a phylogeny-generating pipeline to Lyra in an automated way.

- Figure out logistics of tree output (format it'll be, where files will be stored)
- Figure out how metadata about libraries involved in the tree will be captured
