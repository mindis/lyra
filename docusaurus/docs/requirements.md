## Assumptions

- Tree data will contain cells within leaf nodes, not internal

## Functional

- [[Stories](us-analyses.md)] Select analysis based on what is available
- [[Stories](us-tree.md)] Tree representation for thousands of cells
- [[Stories](us-heatmap.md)] Heatmap (CN, SNV, breakpoint, corrupt tree output) accompanies tree

## Non-Functional

- Responsive and real-time interactions
- Views are able to be compartmentalized
- Unit tests
